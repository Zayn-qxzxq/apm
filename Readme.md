# **Project Title**

## **Introduction**

Intermission Needed is an immersive First Person Shooter game developed using Unreal Engine 4\. The project explores fast-paced multiplayer mechanics, AI-driven Bots system.

## **Problem Statement**

Kazakhstanâ€™s game development scene is emerging but lacks representation in the global AAA market. There is a pressing need to build high-quality, performance-optimized games that demonstrate technical and creative capabilities on par with international standards. Existing FPS titles often focus on graphical realism but fall short in gameplay depth, scalability, and accessible development practices. This project aims to fill that gap by delivering a compelling Unreal Engine 4 prototype that is both visually rich and technically sound. It explores scalable AI, LAN multiplayer, and performance optimization for mid-tier hardware. By doing so, it contributes to the foundational skill sets needed for Kazakhstan to participate meaningfully in AAA game production and nurture a new generation of local talent.

## **Objectives**

* Deliver a playable and stable UE4 game prototype  
* Implement core mechanics  
* Achieve optimized performance for mid-range PCs  
* Explore UE4 Blueprints  
* Provide engaging gameplay and aesthetic design

## **Technology Stack**

* Game Engine: Unreal Engine 4.27+

* Languages: Blueprints Visual Scripting

* Version Control: Git (with Git LFS)

* Asset Creation: Blender, Adobe Photoshop, Quixel Megascans 

* Build Tools: Visual Studio 2019+

## **Installation Instructions**

Step-by-step guide to set up the project locally.

1. Download Project files using the following links:  
   1. Git Repo: git clone https://github.com/Zayn-qxzxq/apm.git  
   2. Git LFS:   
      1. git lfs install   
      2. git lfs pull   
   3. Google Drive: [INF 395 Sufyan Mustafa](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sI-39Nnn-acKKAFZRuW-yX73S3NPfOMF?usp=sharing)  
2. Install Unreal Engine 4  
3. Open Unreal engine in Project Browser  
4. Select the Project and press Open Project  
5. After opening the Project press the Play Button  
6. Now You can Deploy or Exit  
7. After pressing, the Deploy button game starts.

## **Usage Guide**

* Use **WASD** for movement, **mouse** for aiming and shooting.  
* Use R for reload. Skipping reload by trying to fire or aim will make the pistol unusable. You will need to wait until the character reloads it correctly.  
* Character has 50 hp.  
* Timer tracks your record. Try to win as fast as you can.  
* There is no crosshair to make the game more realistic. You need to aim it manually to see where bullets go. After a shot, You need to aim again, it's similar to how guns work in real life, after every shot you need to realign the gun with the target.  
* Bullets are physical objects, with limited distance. To hit the target in the distance you may need to shoot to the point higher than the target. The effective distance for bullet is \~50-100m  
* AI Bots will spawn automatically.

## **Testing** 

* Manual testing in-editor using different player scenarios  
* Blueprint debug tools used for logic validation

## **Known Issues / Limitations** 

* The prop collision boxes are too big, the projectiles are hitting them.  
* The smoothing groups for some meshes are missing.  
* Sounds for reloading are also missing. (Needs to be created using special tools)
